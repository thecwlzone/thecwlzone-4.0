## About My Blog

To set up a RSS feed, copy the URL by hovering over the RSS feed icon on the lower right hand side of this page.

For a complete list of my blog entries, click on the RSS feed icon.

My WordPress blog goes back to 2009, with a total of 142 posts. It's a manual process to convert each entry into
an Astro-based blog, so this will take some time. I'll probably send the trivial and obsolete entries to /dev/null
along the way.

Blog content varies. You could look in the [tags](/tags) page to view the various subjects on my radar.

I don't do Blog Comments. I already spend too much time on the computer, and adding online time for viewing
and responding to comments or feedback would probably land me in divorce court. If you see anything interesting,
please feel free to [contact](/contact) me.

## About This Site

This is version 4.0 of my web site. It is based upon the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework with the
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) integration.

Version 3.0 used [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) with a WordPress blog bolted on. Middleman has served me well, but it's starting to feel obsolete.
[WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), being a wildly successful framework, needs constant upgrading to fend off the hackers. Also, content editing
has changed, and using it seems a bit klugy.

Astro is well integrated with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), so I'm working with that IDE now. It's too "mouse-centric", but adding
the [VSCode Neovim](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim) extension makes it tolerable. The integration with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is pretty cool.

The site theme is based upon [Nordlys](https://nordlys.fjelloverflow.dev/), created by [FjellOverflow](https://fjelloverflow.dev/). It's a pretty amazing
example of an Astro project. I'm humbled...

## About Me

Version 3.0 was more or less a professional biography with lots of travel pictures thrown into the mix.
As I'm now retired, I haven't decided what the non-blog content will entail going forward.

## My Manifesto [^1]

I believe that the rights of the individual are more important than the goals of the collective.

I believe that the biggest impediment to human progress is always The State.

I believe in the Golden Rule.

> I believe that it is better to tell the truth than a lie. I believe it is better to be free than to be a slave. And I believe it is better to know than to be ignorant.

> H. L. Mencken

[^1]: OK, that's pretty pompous, but I wasn't sure what else to call it...
