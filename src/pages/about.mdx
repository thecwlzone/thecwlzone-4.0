## About Me

## About This Site

## Manifesto

I believe that the goals of the individual are more important than the goals of the collective.

I believe that the biggest impediment to human progress is always The State.

I believe in the Golden Rule.

> I believe that it is better to tell the truth than a lie. I believe it is better to be free than to be a slave. And I believe it is better to know than to be ignorant.

> H. L. Mencken
