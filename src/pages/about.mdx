## About This Site

This is version 4.0 of my web site. It is based upon the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework with the
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) integration.

The site theme is based upon [Nordlys](https://nordlys.fjelloverflow.dev/), created by [FjellOverflow](https://fjelloverflow.dev/).

## About Me

Version 3.0 was more or less a professional biography with lots of travel pictures thrown into the mix.
As I'm now retired, I haven't decided what the non-blog content will entail going forward.

## My Manifesto

I believe that the rights of the individual are more important than the goals of the collective.

I believe that the biggest impediment to human progress is always The State.

I believe in the Golden Rule.

> I believe that it is better to tell the truth than a lie. I believe it is better to be free than to be a slave. And I believe it is better to know than to be ignorant.

> [H. L. Mencken](https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/h-l-mencken-quotes)
