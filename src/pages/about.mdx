## About This Site

This is version 4.0 of my web site. It is based upon the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework with the
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) import.

Version 3.0 used [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) with a WordPress blog bolted on. Middleman has served me well, but it's starting to feel obsolete.
[WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), being a wildly successful framework, needs constant upgrading to fend off the hackers. Also, content editing
has changed, and using it seems a bit klugy.

Astro is well integrated with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), so I'm working with that IDE now. It's too "mouse-centric", but adding
the [VSCode Neovim](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim) extension makes it tolerable. The integration with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is pretty cool.

The site theme is based upon [Nordlys](https://nordlys.fjelloverflow.dev/), created by [FjellOverflow](https://fjelloverflow.dev/). It's a pretty amazing
example of an Astro project. I'm humbled...

## About My Blog

My WordPress blog goes back to 2009, with a total of 142 posts. It's a manual process to convert each entry into
an Astro-based blog, so this will take some time. I'll probably send the trivial and obsolete entries to /dev/null
along the way.

Blog content varies. You could look in the [tags](/tags) page to view the various subjects on my radar.

## About Me

Version 3.0 was more or less a professional biography with lots of travel pictures thrown into the mix.
As I'm now retired, I haven't decided what the non-blog content will entail going forward.

## My Manifesto [^1]

I believe that the rights of the individual are more important than the goals of the collective.

I believe that the biggest impediment to human progress is always The State.

I believe in the Golden Rule.

> I believe that it is better to tell the truth than a lie. I believe it is better to be free than to be a slave. And I believe it is better to know than to be ignorant.

> H. L. Mencken

[^1]: OK, that's pretty pompous, but I wasn't sure what else to call it...
