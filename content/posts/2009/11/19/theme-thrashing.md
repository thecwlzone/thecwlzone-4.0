I've never been entirely satisfied with the way my blog looks - it still feels "hard to read", and I'm not sure how to fix that, except to experiment with some other two-column, fixed-width WP themes. So, the site will be undergoing some changes whilst I play around a bit with the look and feel. Thanks for your understanding.

Regards,

Chris "Tweaker" Lehman
