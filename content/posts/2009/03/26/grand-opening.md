After a long hiatus, I am ready to start blogging again, this time with WordPress.

I hadn't done much with my web site for awhile, so as preliminaries, I upgraded to MySQL 5.0. WordPress installed without a hitch, but I had to get the good folks at [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net) to change my DNS/canonical name settings to get the redirects to behave.

Today, I finally settled on a [WP theme](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/deep-silent), and promptly customized the CSS and HTML This will be an ongoing tweak for a bit longer, I'm sure.

Now I'm too tired to write anything, but at least I'm back on the air. Cheers!
