It's highly unlikely that I'll make it to RailsConf this year, due to continuing employment uncertainties. Too bad, since it's close by in Las Vegas. Vegas is hurting, so I understand the room rates are still at $99 a night.

I went to the first RailsConf 2006 in Chicago on my own dime, just to have the bragging rights. It was great fun, and all the presentations were good quality. I haven't been able to attend since O'Reilly took over the event, but it looks pretty professional. Here's a pic of me at RailsConf 2006. A couple of wise guys were working the event, and taking pictures of people who had the audacity to bring non-Mac laptops.

(Note: The pic has been lost in the mists of time... Bummer...)

The certificate says "Thanks for bringing a Windows machine to RailsConf. Signed, Bill Gates", or something like that. And I'm still Mac-deprived, I'm afraid.
