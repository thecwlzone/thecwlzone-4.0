## Introduction

I'm always looking for accurate, reasonably unbiased news and information sources. My own list is pretty biased towards anarchy (see the last section of this article), so I know there is room for improvement. Hence, the question posed to our modern day Oracles:

## The Question

_What are the best unbiased news and information web sites?_

## The Responses

Copied verbatum from the web page, although I had to make some minor cosmetic changes to the text in order to make [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) happy.

Finding truly unbiased news is challenging, as every outlet operates with some level of perspective, whether due to editorial policy, ownership, or audience expectations. However, there are sources known for striving toward neutral, fact-based reporting and maintaining transparency about their methods. Here's a list of some of the most frequently recommended for relatively unbiased news:

- Avoid infotainment—flashy, emotional stories often favor engagement over truth.
  Would you like a custom shortlist depending on your country or topics of interest (e.g., politics, science, tech)?

## Discussion

- WTF? These lists look like they have come from some kind of [Democratic National Committee](https://democrats.org/) recommended reading list. NPR?!!! Bwhahaha! PBS?!!! Gag me with a spoon... The War Street Journal? Please... New York Times? I think not... And I don't believe that _any_ of these sources gave us the straight scoop on _any_ COVID-related information.

- Interesting that Al Jazerra shows up a few times - I have been intending to check out that site for awhile...

- Slightly different response from Brave Search versus Leo (Brave's chatbox) - good to know...

I guess I will have to do a deeper dive into the LLM sources for the individual chatbots - it's like the data is all from the same model... Man, what a disappointment...
