Well, another RailsConf event has come and gone, and I wasn't there, damn it! Too bad, Austin is the only civilized city in Texas, and it's pretty close to my location, but no luck. The usual restraints - time and money.

Once again, I'm so glad I went to the first Rails conference in 2006 in Chicago on my own nickel. I think most of the people that attended RailsConf 2006 did the same. The event was held over the weekend, because none of us could justify a couple of days from our day jobs, which at the time was largely _not_ Rails development. Probably the only people making money on Rails development back then was [Dave Hansson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson) aka Mr. RoR, Dave Thomas, co-author of the Ruby Pickaxe book, andÂ  [Chad Fowler](https://github.com/chad) and [David Black](https://www.davidablack.net), a couple of the organizers. (Apparently if your name is David, you'll do well in this sector.)

There was roughly 500 - 600 people in attendance, although it felt smaller and more intimate for some reason. DHH did one of the keynote speeches, and the legendary [Why](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff) and his band provided the entertainment. Very cool. The event was very well organized, although there was a pretty short list of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.

Fast forward six years. What a difference. I don't remember how much I paid for admission at RailsConf 2006, but it sure as hell wasn't $750 - WTF? For a conference two-and-a-half days long? Sheesh! I hope everybody got First Class treatment for that price.

Be that as it may, I understand from a blog or two that the event was attended by a lot of first time folks. That's great news - the Rails community is still growing and vibrant. Maybe a little too vibrant sometimes, but that's a topic for another day. In the meantime, there are a couple of Ruby / Rails events later this year around the Denver / Boulder area that I hope will be more within my price range. Cheers!
