The folks at [Deno](https://deno.com/) have a [blog post](https://deno.com/blog/history-of-javascript) that shows a timeline of Javascript's origins and evolution. It brought back a lot of memories...

- I didn't know that [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) was created by Brendan Eich in only 10 days back in 1995. That explains a lot. I remember taking a brief class in Javascript programming, and I wasn't impressed. Too many semicolons and too many parentheses to manage...

- I got a kick out of seeing the old [Netscape Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) browser again.

- Microsoft added JScript to [Internet Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer) in 1995, and then added more "customized" (aka proprietary) Javascript into IE 5 in 1999, effectively starting the IE browser monopoly that would continue until the release of Google [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) in 2008.

- [AJAX](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp) was introduced in 2004, with the release of [Google's](https://www.google.com/) [Gmail](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en-US/gmail/) product. I remember struggling with AJAX in [Rails 3](https://rubyonrails.org/), if I recall correctly.

- John Resig created [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) in 2006. I worked with jQuery and the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) for quite awhile.

- Microsoft released [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 1.0 in 2016. I mention this because I'm currently using VS Code version 1.100. With the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extensions, many of my objections to Javascript programming have been laid to rest. Now if could just get [VSCode Neovim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim) configured that way I need it...

The blog is worth a read, and unlike this post, it includes a lot of cool pictures.
