## Introduction

A couple of weeks ago I asked [Lumo](https://lumo.proton.me/guest) to find me some information sources pertaining to hacks, data breaches, ransomware, security attacks, etc. One of the returned sites was [DataBreaches.Net](https://databreaches.net/)

I was especially intrigued by this one, as it appears to be run by a woman about my age, who uses the _nom de plume_ of Dissent Doe. Cool.

The site is circa 2009, about the same time TheCWLZone was created. It's chock full of security news and information. Highly recommended.

## The No Kings Protest of October 18th

Occasionally Dissent offers some commentary on current issues, and the No Kings protest was a topic last week (week of October 12th, 2025)

The complete article is worth a read, and it's located here:
[No Kings](https://databreaches.net/2025/10/18/no-kings-not-today-not-ever/)

I'm of two minds on this one - I appreciate the need for holding the current administration accountable, but this protest against Trump Caesar seems to be funded by billionaire oligarchs whose values appear to run towards marxism rather than libertarianism. Thus, my sentiments run along this point of view: [The No Kings Protest Is Insurrection](https://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2025/10/19/the-no-kings-protest-is-insurrection/)

However, Dissent's thoughts on the subject are generally well founded, and I thought it would be a useful exercise to think about and reply to her concerns.

I have extracted Dissent's observations from the article (italics added by me), and my comments are bulleted after each one.

_The convicted felon in the White House acts like a mob boss and misuses the Department of Justice to intimidate anyone who opposes him. At the same time, he pardons or commutes the sentences of fraudsters and criminals if they voted for him or made a donation to him._

- Convicted felon? That's news to me. _Ad hominem_ attacks aside, this situation is not a Donnie Caesar feature, this is a POTUS [^1] Caesar feature. It's what happens when a republic degenerates into a dictatorship - a constant power struggle by various factions, all consisting of the worst rogues and mountebanks of our society. [^2] Stay fit and keep your powder dry.

_Masked agents grab people off the streets or in buildings. Some of those being detained may be serious criminals. Others are citizens or lawful residents who are wrongly detained, including people whose views Trump doesn’t like._

- I'm not happy about how this is being handled either. But Biden Caesar allowed an estimated 8 - 10 million invaders to cross our borders. [^3] They need to be identified, captured and deported. I'll have to reluctantly agree to support this one, despite the obvious dangers.

_Trump is sending troops into cities that neither want nor need troops. The military is not supposed to be used as police against citizens._

- I am unhappy about this as well, as the next Caesar could very well make _us_ the target. But it sure seems like the big cities in our country are not safe for decent people anymore, and the people in charge don't seem very concerned about that. So - with great trepidation - I support the current policies.

_Trump is attempting to dictate the policies universities can adopt, threatening to cut off federal funding if they do not comply._

- This one is easy - eliminate federal funding to all universities.

_Trump enabled Netanyahu to pursue inhumane attacks on Gaza that killed innocent Palestinians or starved them to death. He treated Netanyahu like a hero instead of as a war criminal._

- 100 per cent agree on this one. [AIPAC](AIPAC.org) and a handful of Jewish billionaires have dictated FedGov foreign policy in the Middle East for far too long. [^4] Eliminate all financial support to Israel and adopt a neutral policy regarding the Levant. While we're at it, eliminate _all_ foreign aid payments to _everybody_.

_Trump claims socialism is bad, but sends billions of U.S. dollars to a socialist country so that their citizens will have free health care, while millions of Americans will not be able to afford healthcare._

- I'm not sure which socialist country is being targeted here, but yes, I agree 100 per cent. No foreign aid to anybody, period.

_Trump has kissed Putin’s ass so many times that Putin probably has hickeys on his ass. Ukraine deserves our full support._

- Totally _disagree_ on this one. Personal insults notwithstanding, Ukraine is within Russia's sphere of influence. The Neocon Russophobes that infest the FedGov Deep State fomented revolution within Ukraine, and the Russians had to act. [^5] If Russia was disrupting Mexico's government and culture, what kind of response would you expect from the US Government? It may be that the author's ethnic background has some emotional capital involved here, which would certainly color _my_ attitude about the current situation...

_Trump has appointed incompetent people who have made us and our country less safe. He appears to have appointed them simply because they donate to him, feed his ego, or look like plastic-surgeon-generated Barbies._

- How is this behavior different from any previous POTUS Caesar? This is starting to sound like Trump Derangment Syndrome [^6], although having never met the author, I could certainly be wrong about that. Moving on...

## Final Thoughts

I appreciate Dissent's valid viewpoints. And let me be clear - although I'm not a fan of Donald Trump, I am glad that somebody the media cannot ignore is actively working against the woke/gay/marxist ideology that has permeated every aspect of American culture. But even that is a sham. [^7]

Enough! Mind your own business, keep your hands to yourself, pay your own way, and stay outta my face.
