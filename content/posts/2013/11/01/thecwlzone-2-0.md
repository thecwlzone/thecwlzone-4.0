Welcome to the new look and feel of TheCWLZone.com

I decided to use [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/), a Ruby-based static site generator to create the 2.0 version of my web site. I use nanoc to build content, run the content through the nanoc compiler and then run [git](http://git-scm.com/) to upload the generated HTML pages to my site’s public directory.

I use a number of web tools to create various effects on the site. See the “Generated by” section of the footnotes at the bottom of the pages for a complete list.

I have decided to continue to use the [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) blog tool even though nanoc has some very powerful built-in blogging features. I know Wordpress has a lot of overhead, there are constant updates, it’s a favorite hacker target, blah, blah, blah. But it suits my purposes, and I don’t want to burn anymore development time on the site right now. Maybe later.

Let me know what you think of the new format. Thanks for your interest. Cheers!
