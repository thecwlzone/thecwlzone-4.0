I have decided to go with the Wordpress [twentysixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/) theme, with alterations to the CSS styling to use theÂ Merriweather Sans, Verdana, and sans-serif font families, as I don't really care for serif fonts in general.

Not very innovative, but when I get thousands of blog readers, maybe I'll try something else.

One other consideration: I have turned off comments for this blog. If you read anything of interest, please contact me via email. Thanks!
