Why would anyone create a Wordpress theme allegedly for blogs without providing hooks for displaying posts as excerpts (aka the Read More link)? I'm looking at you [TwentySixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/)¬†- yeah, I could create a Child Theme, hack on some PHP, yada yada. Not happening...

The [Exoplanet](https://wordpress.org/themes/exoplanet/) theme is pretty cool, and it took mere moments to install and tweak. And there are only 600+ active installs, so my blog UI is almost unique. üòè
