I was kinda waiting for the AI feeding frenzy to die down a bit, but I guess that's not going to happen anytime soon. Soooo...

## Introduction

My AI skills are 20 years out of date, focusing on neural network and expert system tools that were available at that time. I know the basics, but everything else I know is obsolete. Onwards...

## Current Software and Hardware Limitations

This AI stuff wants to use a boatload of compute resources, well beyond my current capabilities. My 8 year old MacBook Air (circa 2017) is running an obsolete OS (Monterey 12.7.6) with only 8 GB of RAM, and with no longer any viable support from the [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) community. Other than that, it's a fine machine, yuk yuk.

I'm supporting this site using the [Astro Framework](https://astro.build/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) running on a [Ubuntu 24.04.2](https://ubuntu.com/blog/tag/ubuntu-24-04-lts) image hosted on the Mac using [VMware Fusion Player Version 13.5.2](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion) (also obsolete). Ugly, but serviceable for web site development, but useless for any AI R&D.

The [System 76](https://system76.com/) laptop I'm lusting after will come with a $2k price tag, which is tough to justify when you are a retired old fart. Plus, I really need to get the wife off of that God-Awful Windows 11 [bloatware](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2224766/goodbye-bloatware-how-to-clean-out-windows-11s-cruft.html) first. So for the near-term future I'll have to confine myself to being a normal schmuck user of the various chatbots available on the web. Sigh...

## A Quick Chatbot Survey

There are a number articles to be found if you search for "best AI chatbots". This one was pretty good:

[Zapier Chatbot Review](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-chatbot/)

Interestingly, no reviews mentioned [Venice](https://venice.ai/), a Swiss-based AI chatbot that doesn't keep any of your data around. I did find a ChatGPT versus Venice comparison here:

[Run the Prompts ChatGPT versus Venice](https://runtheprompts.com/resources/venice-ai-info/venice-ai-vs-chatgpt/)

Proton has also just released [Lumo](https://proton.me/blog/lumo-ai), another privacy-centric chatbot that you would expect from the Proton folks.

## Chatbot Selection Criteria

- Price : As in Free. I'm already spending too much on internet, phone and entertainment stuff, I don't need to add yet another monthly subscription cost into the mix.

- Privacy: I don't trust any of the big players, so products from Microsoft, Apple, Google, etc are out of the running.

- Politically and Socially Unbiased: Just the facts, Ma'am. This may turn out to be a Grail Search.

## Testing Criteria

This will vary, and I will probably turn the tests into individual posts for purposes of brevity. My current plan is to test against technical (e.g. software development problems and research), current events analysis, social commentary and general "how-to" topics.

## The Contenders

At this point I will probably confine my research to the following chatbots:

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?openaicom_referred=true), free version, no login

- [Venice](https://venice.ai), free version, no login

- [Lumo](https://proton.me/blog/lumo-ai), since I already have a Proton account in place

- [The Brave search engine](https://search.brave.com/)

- [Leo](https://brave.com/leo/), free version, the Brave chatbot built into the browser

I will run all tests using the Brave browser, installed on my Ubuntu 24.04.2 OS image running on the Mac. I don't do mobile - I don't use my phone for anything except actual phone calls, a bit of texting and 2FA authentication.
