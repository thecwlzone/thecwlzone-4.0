A brief digression into libertarianism... [Professor Hoppe](http://www.hanshoppe.com/) gives an excellent summary of [the basics of libertarian thinking](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2018/01/hans-hermann-hoppe/on-getting-libertarianism-right/), and how it is currently being polluted. With additional commentary by the [Bionic Mosquito](https://bionicmosquito.blogspot.com/2018/01/dilly-dilly.html).

My thoughts: Historically, people have placed their loyalty with family, local community and tribe, in that order. When a nation's culture and traditions are systematically attacked and devalued, people will look to the State for order and purpose. This is exactly what our self-appointed masters want, and it always ends badly for people like ourselves.
