Check out the new format for the [web site](http://www.thecwlzone.com). It's using the vanilla-flavored [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) styling - that will need to be fixed. Built with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), a more "Railsy" kind of static site generator.

Details to follow after I complete the content and styling, and add a sexier theme to the site. Cheers!
