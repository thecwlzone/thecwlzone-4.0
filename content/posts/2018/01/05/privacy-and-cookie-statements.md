I have added some information about cookies and privacy on the site. I'm not a lawyer, and I don't want to go into legalese, so it's real simple:

1. I don't collect any personal or financial information at this site, so I don't need to use [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) - but see 2 below.
2. I am running a vanilla-flavored, out-of-the-box configuration of [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none), just to see if anybody is visiting the site. (They are not.)
3. Cookies created in your browser are from Google Analytics. As of this writing, the cookies are \_ga, \_gat and \_gid.Â  You can read about cookies here: [https://cookiepedia.co.uk](https://cookiepedia.co.uk/) . There are also some [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) cookies generated as a result of visiting the blog.

I may get cute and add some EU-style [cookie opt-out](https://cookiepedia.co.uk/giving-consent-to-cookies) features someday if I get bored. Don't hold your breath. Cheers!
