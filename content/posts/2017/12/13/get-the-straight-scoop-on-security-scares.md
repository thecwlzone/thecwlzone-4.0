I'm not a security expert (that's a highly specialized, highly compensated branch of the Computer Science biz), but my current job description requires me to be aware of the latest issues, outbreaks, hysterias, etc. The best all-around general resource I have found so far is Brian Krebs at [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/). It's good info for professionals and non-professionals alike. As an example, take a look at the latest "enhancements" to [phishing attacks](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/phishers-are-upping-their-game-so-should-you/).
