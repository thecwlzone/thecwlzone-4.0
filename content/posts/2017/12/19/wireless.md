After suffering on a satellite connection for more years than I wish to reveal, I had two wireless ISPs become available in my area over the summer. I decided to go with [DirectLink](http://mydl.com/), mainly because they were ready to hook up about a month before [Kellin Communications](https://kellin.net/residential).

Hey, it's not Comcast (my nearest Comcast connection is 10 miles away. Remote areas will never get fiber, it's just too expensive.) speeds, but it's been highly reliable, and most everything works now, including Google Hangout and Slack. _And no data caps!_ Hooray!

So - what is this [NetFlix](https://www.netflix.com/) of which you speak?
