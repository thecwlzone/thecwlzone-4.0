Two weeks of bottle conditioning, so it's time for the taste test!

As usual, my official [Colorado Avalanche](https://www.nhl.com/avalanche) beer mug holds the full 22 ounces:

**Head Retention**: Good. Large bubbles in the foam.

**Clarity**: Good. Some slight cloudiness, but very acceptable for a homebrew system that does not include any kind of filtering step.

**Color**: Almost a red ale color. The [BJCP](https://www.bjcp.org/) guidelines specify "amber to dark brown", so I think I hit the target.

**Carbonation**: Medium to High, although it droped off considerably before I could finish the mug. I used 4 ounces of corn sugar for the bottle conditioning, I'm guessing that 3 ounces would have been more "true" to Scottish Ale carbonation levels.

**Flavor**: Good! The hoppiness was at the correct level, and the malt came through as expected.

**Overall**: I think this one needs a little more bottle conditioning, as the initial storage temperature was a bit low, 63 F to 65 F. I expect this batch to improve with time. Cheers!
