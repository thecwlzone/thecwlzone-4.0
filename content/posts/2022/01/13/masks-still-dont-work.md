Dr. Scott Gottlieb, resident Regime Physician at CNN was interviewed on CBS News Face the Nation on January 2nd, 2020. (Link in the References section.)

> DR. GOTTLIEB: Cloth masks aren't going to provide a lot of protection, that's the bottom line. This is an airborne illness. We now understand that, and a cloth mask is not going to protect you from a virus that spreads through airborne transmission. It could protect better through droplet transmission, something like the flu, but not something like this coronavirus.

Thanks, Doc, some of us knew that two years ago, but we're glad to see you are finally coming around.
