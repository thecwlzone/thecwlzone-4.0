[Jeffrey Tucker](https://brownstone.org/author/jeffrey-tucker/) over at the [Brownstone Institute](https://brownstone.org/) has published an article naming the culprits responsible for the horrendous damage done by fanatical public health "experts" and know-nothing politicians:

[The Vindication of D.A. Henderson](https://brownstone.org/articles/the-vindication-of-d-h-henderson/)

The article reinforces [my investigations](https://www.thecwlzone.com/blog/the-doctor-who-eradicated-smallpox-says-were-doing-it-all-wrong/) from a year ago when I found a paper written in 2006 and co-authored by Dr Henderson (who led the teams that globally eradicated smallpox in the late 1970's) that refuted all of the bogus mitigation measures that have been inflicted upon us for over two years.

I was particularly struck by the quote from a [Dr. Carter Mecher](https://www.phc.health/team-member/carter-mecher-md):

> _“If you got everyone and locked each of them in their own room and didn’t let them talk to anyone, you would not have any disease.”_

Universal solitary confinement as a solution to a pandemic. I'm speechless. And this guy is one of the people that "was a principal author of the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan", according to his [current bio](https://www.phc.health/team-member/carter-mecher-md).

"Experts", by definition, suffer from tunnel vision. Infectious disease experts do not view us as human beings. Instead, we are filthy walking disease vectors that must be contained and controlled at all costs. These "experts" have no expertise or interest in economies, societies or human psychology. Experts are the worst class of people to be setting public policy.

In theory, our elected officials elicit expert opinion on both sides of an issue and then synthesize public policy that would, one would hope, "first do no harm". This was not done in response to the COVID virus - doctors exceeded their authority, and politicians let them get away with it, and We the People get to pick up the pieces.

We cannot allow this to happen again.
