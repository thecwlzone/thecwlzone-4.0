[Iceland Review](https://www.icelandreview.com/) reported on February 23rd that all COVID restrictions would be lifted on Friday, February 25th.

Here's the [link](https://www.icelandreview.com/society/iceland-to-lift-all-covid-restrictions-on-friday/) to the article.

A [status report](https://www.icelandreview.com/ask-ir/whats-the-status-of-covid-19-in-iceland/) dated today (February 28th) confirms the lifting of all domestic restrictions.

In addition, there are [no longer any travel restrictions](https://www.icelandreview.com/ask-ir/can-i-travel-to-iceland-post-covid-19-in-2022/) at the border - [unless you are are a Russian citizen](https://www.icelandreview.com/politics/iceland-closes-airspace-to-russia/).

Good news indeed, but Icelanders, like the rest of us, will need to make it very clear that we are done with this crap, now and in the future.

> Asked whether COVID-19 measures could be reimposed in the future, Katrín stated: “We are always ready for the possibility that a new variant could emerge,” and added that authorities would continue to monitor the state of the pandemic domestically and globally.
