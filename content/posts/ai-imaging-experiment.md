## Introduction

Inspired by the recent [amelia meme](https://trending.knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-is-pathways-and-who-is-amelia-the-controversial-memes-about-the-viral-uk-anti-immigration-goth-girl-explained) storm as reported by John Carter at [Postcards From Barsoom](https://barsoom.substack.com/p/amelia-sans-merci) (as well as many others), I decided I needed to gain some rudimentary knowledge of AI image editing and generation.

I was also inspired by the [DataBreaches](https://databreaches.net/) splash page depicting the author in front of her three screens. I thought, "I can do that", so I decided on an AI image experiment that would insert an AI-generated human into my home office setup.

I asked [Lumo](https://lumo.proton.me/guest) to build me a list of free AI image tools, and I curated that into the short list below.

## The Base Photo

I took the home office photo with my Samsung Galaxy A13 5G phone. It created a 2.3 MByte JPG file. The reduced version is shown here:

_Original photo of The CWL Zone World Headquarters._

## The Prompt

[NoteGPT](https://notegpt.io/) allows 2 free images per day, and I used that to refine the prompt. I initially forgot to specify a beard and glasses. Duh. I'm kind of surprised that I did not need to specify "_white_ male". And yes, even though I'm an Official Old Fart, I still wear a leather jacket. I own two, actually. It's a Detroit thing, you wouldn't understand...

_Add a person sitting in front of the computer, typing on the keyboard and looking at the screens. The person is an older male, with slightly balding short grey hair, a trimmed grey beard, glasses, and is wearing a black leather jacket._

## The Process

If I could upload and edit the photo without any credentials, I did so. Otherwise, I used my Google credentials so I would not have to create yet another online account. This may have been a tactical error, see the Discussion section...

Once the base photo was uploaded, I entered the prompt as shown above. Processing was fast, less than two minutes in all cases.

The altered photo was downloaded and reduced (except as noted). No additional edits were made.

## NoteGPT

[NoteGPT](https://notegpt.io/) was pretty easy to use, and I may play around with it some more at a later date.

I used my Google account to login...

The original version is too large for a web page, and the reduced version is too small, but since I don't like the result anyway, I don't care.

_Hmm, odd head positioning..._

## Craiyon

[Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com/en) is a bit too artsy-fartsy for me, but I'm guessing it's a pretty valuable tool for people that do imaging as part of a profit stream.

Same problem as the previous - the original version is too large for a web page, and the reduced version is too small, but since I don't like the result anyway, I don't care.

_I **did** say "looking at the screens"..._

## DeepAI

[DeepAI](ihttps://deepai.org/) promotes a lot of wildlife and conservation thingies, which may or may not be of some interest to me. I'll be taking a closer look at these folks at a later date.

A login was not required for this one...

I used the original rendered result, no image reduction.

_Hey, not bad..._

## NightCafe

[NightCafe](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/) is another art-centric site. The free imaging comes with a mandatory watermark, which is reasonable, I suppose...

A login was not required for this one...

I used the original rendered result, no image reduction.

_Ugh! I'm not quite **that** bald..._

## starryai

[starrayai](https://starryai.com/) was a bit underwhelming, although I can't explain why I feel that way.

A login/account was required, so I used my Google account.

Uploading the photo, and launching the prompt generated a "Not enough lumins" message, i.e. pay for a subscription, you deadbeat. So this one is off the table.

## Discussion

This is pretty scary stuff - the rendered image does look a lot like me. Yikes. How could that happen? Conjecture: I uploaded a picture of myself to my Google account back when I was silly enough to believe that Google was relatively benign. Also, the character string "thecwlzone" is pretty unique, and Google knows that I own the domain name. Did that cause the LLM search to pull all that together and build a virtual Chris Lehman? Yowza!

Elapsed time on this project: about 2 hours, plus putting this blog together. Generating AI images is truly available to the masses, for better or for worse.

## Conclusions

The DeepAI image was my favorite, and I plan on inserting the image into the Page 1 of my blog section at some point.

I'll probably do more AI imaging in future blogs - I believe the SEO gurus still think that images in blog posts increases user interest, and blah, blah, blah... Plus it _is_ kinda fun to see what gets created.
