## Introduction

The White House has published a new page on its site, entitled [Lab Leak](https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/) The True Origins of COVID-19.

**Executive Summary: Everything we were told about COVID was a lie.**

Some of us recognized the deception early on. It's my main motivation for resurrecting my blog entries, because for what it's worth, I tried to document what was happening as it was happening. As such, it might be of some minor historical value, not that anybody will care about my opinions and observations...

Now, I'm not the brightest bulb in the package, but as a [Flower Child of the 1960's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_child) (1), I learned a basic truth early on:

**All Governments lie. All of the time. About everything.**

So when the fear campaign kicked into high gear in Q1 2020, I turned off the TV and started to do my own research.

**Initial findings:** COVID had a fatality rate like a bad flu season, with really old, really sick people as the folks most at risk. _The rest of us should have been allowed to function normally._

But we were not given that option. No way in hell. _Why not?_ Why were we subjected to idiotic masking theater, useless social distancing, shutdowns of everything but Walmart and liquor stores, and the worldwide house arrest of healthy people?

At this point I rely heavily on the amazing research done by some amazing people at the [Brownstone Institute](https://brownstone.org). What follows is a synthesis of their research and my personal experience.

## Brownstone Institute Research

> ...Covid was not a public health event, although it was presented as such to the world’s population. It was a global operation, coordinated through public-private intelligence and military alliances and invoking laws designed for CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear) weapons attacks.

> [The COVID Dossier](https://brownstone.org/articles/the-covid-dossier/)

> ...our response to the Covid pandemic was led by groups and agencies that are in the business of responding to wars and terrorist threats, not public health crises or disease outbreaks.

> [Government’s National Security Arm Took Charge During the Covid Response](https://brownstone.org/articles/governments-national-security-arm-led-the-covid-response/)

> At its core, the Covid response was a military operation. It uncovered the entangled webs of ostensibly distinct structures of military and health operations. The National Security Council sparked the panicked response, the Department of Homeland Security oversaw lockdowns, the Intelligence Community, led by the CIA, censored dissent, and the Department of Defense administered the vaccine push.

## My Current Working Hypothesis

- COVID is an engineered virus, created at the Wuhan, China lab, and most likely funded by the Department of Defense (DOD)

- The virus escaped from the lab, probably due to negligence

- The DOD honchos, not knowing what the virus would do in the wild, and unwilling to accept responsibility, pushed the Biowarfare Panic Button

- All of the fearmongering was designed to keep as many people as possible locked down until a cure could be rolled out. Quarantine until vaccine.

> When the military and national security agencies took over the response, these guidelines were replaced by a biowarfare paradigm: Quarantine until vaccine. In other words, keep everyone locked down while rapidly developing medical countermeasures. This is a response intended to counter biowarfare and bioterrorism attacks. It is not a public health response and is, in fact, in direct conflict with the scientific and ethical underpinnings of established public health principles.

> [What If There Had Been No Covid Coup?](https://brownstone.org/articles/what-if-there-had-been-no-covid-coup/)

- Ironically, the "cure" was worse than the disease. The filthy COVID injections did not create immunity, did not stop transmission and have injured and killed millions of people worldwide.

> While the FDA and CDC continue to extol the benefits of the Covid vaccines, they have ignored a growing body of evidence that these products can also be harmful.

## Conclusion

Thanks to the Lab Leak document we have the names and faces of the principal actors. _We know who did this to us._ They need to be called to account. Some people are demanding arrest, trial and jail time. I concur, but that may be politically impossible - too much money, influence and power in play. But at the very least, everybody involved in this atrocity should not be pulling a paycheck funded by We The People.
