## Introduction

I forget what motivated me to try this, but I went over to [DeepAI](https://deepai.org), and fired up its music generator.

## The Prompt

I entered this prompt:

_create a one minute guitar solo that sounds like Jimi Hendrix in mp3 audio format_.

## Result 1

Here's the [created audio](/jimi_audio.mp3)

WTF? What _is_ this, [Barry Manilow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Manilow) does Jimi Hendrix? Yuk!

## Result 2

Note that the AI Generator has a button to click on an "Olde" model.

OK, trying that, I got [this audio](/jimi_old_audio.mp3).

Still underwhelming, but at least there is some Hendrix-y distortion in the track.

## And Lest We Forget

Jimi Hendrix - accept no substitutes...

## Discussion

OK, DeepAI is a really small company attempting to provide AI tools for the downtrodden and the cheapskates of the world (I'm in the latter category), so I'm sure there are much better AI music generators available from the Big Players, especially if you fork over the big bucks for their premium and pro subscription tiers. And hats off to DeepAI for providing an easy path to music generation. Anyway, DeepAI will be good enough for my musical needs, which will probably be none at all.

## Footnote

Jimi's [Are You Experienced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Experienced) album was released in May of 1967. I was a high school junior at the time, and [Purple Haze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Haze) tore my head off. I also had the privilege of seeing Jimi play live at the [San Diego Sports Arena](https://www.jimihendrix.com/encyclopedia-item/may-24-1969-a-superb-set-which-yielded-some-of-the-guitarists-best-loved-live-recordings/) on May 24, 1969, widely regarded as one of his best live performances. It _was_ pretty Cosmic...

I don't consider myself to be a fan boy, but Jimi is the one exception.
