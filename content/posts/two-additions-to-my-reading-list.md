## Book Review 1

I ran across a link at the [Lew Rockwell](https://www.lewrockwell.com/) site that pointed me to an article at [City Journal](https://www.city-journal.org/) (see References below) which contained a book review by author David Zweig: "An Abundance of Caution: American Schools, the Virus, and a Story of Bad Decisions". The author describes his research into how and why government schools were closed and why they were closed for so long. Zwieg found numerous examples of sloppy science, faulty assumptions and an over-reliance on dubious computer modeling exercises. Let's explore that last item a bit more...

## Computer Modeling and Public Policy

Prior to my retirement in 2019, computer modeling and simulation of integrated circuits was one of my areas of expertise.[^1] [^2] These simulations are very effective because we can accurately model transistors, capacitors and other circuit elements. We can build - and measure - transistor behavior and transcribe that information into software.

Modeling human behavior and biological systems is not so precise because the data is vast and often ambiguous. (I challenge any AI guru to build me an accurate model describing Love, Anger, Grief, etc. Good luck with that.) _Fuzzy data will yield fuzzy results._ Modeling virus contagion patterns is a useful exercise, _but it cannot be used as a basis for forming public policy_. At best, social and medical simulations can be an _adjunct_ tool, but that's it. Unfortunately, computer modeling was marketed as Real Science during the COVID hysteria as documented by Zweig in his book.

One additional point I need to make: provide me with the code, the data set and a sufficient amount of time and I can alter the initial conditions, the assumptions made in the software and manipulate the data to provide you (and your financial backer) with any outcome you desire. The only people who can refute my "findings" would be people with similar expertise who take the (_pro bono_) time to replicate my results and explain why my conclusions are junk science. This is a really poor foundation for making policy decisions.

## But Why Did This Happen?

Zweig does not attempt to explain why pubic officials refused to deviate from obviously flawed science, but the article's author, James B. Meigs tries to tie it to "Trump Tribalism", i.e. any tactic that stopped Trump from being re-elected was fair game. The ends justify the means. Although this was certainly a factor, there was a much bigger influence, which brings me to:

## Book Review 2

[Debbie Lerman](https://brownstone.org/author/debbie-lerman/), [Brownstone Institute](https://brownstone.org/) Fellow and journalist has published "The Deep State Goes Viral: Pandemic Planning and the Covid Coup" (see References below). The real reason for the COVID policies: it was a military biowarfare counter-terrorism response.

[Jeffrey A. Tucker](https://brownstone.org/author/jeffrey-tucker/) provides a forward to the book, which is also available as a [Brownstone article](https://brownstone.org/articles/the-deep-state-goes-viral-foreword/).

I can also recommend Lerman's numerous Brownstone [articles](https://brownstone.org/author/debbie-lerman/) which most likely have been incorporated into her book.

In brief, on or around March 13th, 2020, pandemic response policy was transferred to the National Security Council (NSC) under the auspices of "national security". It was a deep state coup at an international level. The public health agencies were following orders as directed by the NSC. That sure does explain a lot, at least to me anyway.

These two books will be some heavy reading for the summer, and will probably requre some heavy drinking in order to cope with the realities. (That was a joke - two beers, and I'm comatose nowadays...)
