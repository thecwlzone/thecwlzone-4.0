The wife was watching [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video-ceo-interviews/), (and watching the DOW drop by ~2,000 points), and she noted that Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, and Satya Nadella (former and present Microsoft CEOs)
were being [interviewed](https://www.cnbc.com/video-ceo-interviews/).

"[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) turns 50 today", she said.

Wow.

I have mixed feelings about Microsoft, and I have _very_ strong feelings about what Bill Gates is doing with his enormous fortune, but I must admit that my first emotion upon hearing that Microsoft Turns Fifty was a strong sense of awe.

We truly live in amazing times, and I feel privileged to have had a front row seat to the technological advances that have taken place during my lifetime, coupled with a bit of pride that I may have made a few small contributions over a 30+ year career in high tech.

I am very concerned that technological advances are often turned into weapons to be used against We The People, but that's not the fault of the technology _per se_, it's the psychopaths in charge who are using the technology for evil purposes. I don't have a fix for that, except to keep my powder dry...

So, congratulations to all Microsoft employees, past and present, may you acquire wisdom along with your technical expertise.
