On 10 November, 1775, the United States Marine Corps was formed in [Tun Tavern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tun_Tavern), Philadelphia, PA, with [Samuel Nicholas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Nicholas) as the first USMC Commandant.

I stepped onto the [MCRD San Diego](https://www.mcrdsd.marines.mil/) [yellow footprints](https://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/527487/yellow-footprints-the-initial-step-into-recruit-training/) in September of 1968, and I was on active duty until September of 1972.

The [Vietnam war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) was still active at the time, but I was never in country, and I did not see combat. This was a very good thing, as I am a mediocre warrior and an excellent target...

Because I enlisted for four years, the Marine Corps guaranteed me a school [^1], so I spent most of 1969 in San Diego earning my MOS 2841 Ground Radio Repairman certificate[^2].

I repaired the gear at [Marine Base 29 Palms, CA](https://www.29palms.marines.mil/) during most of 1970,

and for the remainder of my hitch I performed various security duties at Marine Barracks [Yokosuka Naval Base, Japan](https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/commanderfa/)

The Corps was a microcosm of American culture during the late 1960s: there was an undercurrent of racial tension, rampant drug and alchohol use, and a general discontent with established authority. I confess to succumbing to some of those influences, but in my defense my [DD-214](https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/dd-214) shows that I was awarded the Good Conduct Medal, a Letter of Recognition (I placed first at the 29 Palms NCO School), I consistently qualified as a Rifle Sharpshooter, I attained the rank of Sergeant within three years, and I was Honorably Discharged, so I wasn't a total shitbird, to use the vernacular of the times. I could have been a better Marine, and I regret that, but I don't know how much more could have been expected out of a 21 year old kid from Detroit...

What did I learn during my active duty time? I learned that all governments lie. All the time. About everything. As a result, my social and political philosophies align more with [Smedley Butler](https://americanswhotellthetruth.org/portraits/major-general-smedley-butler/) rather than [Chesty Puller](https://www.usmcu.edu/Research/Marine-Corps-History-Division/People/Whos-Who-in-Marine-Corps-History/Paige-Russell/Lieutenant-General-Lewis-Chesty-B-Puller/).

I also learned that I have difficulty taking orders from people who are my intellectual inferiors; since that time I have endeavoured to surround myself with friends, family and colleagues who are smarter than me. I am pleased to report that I have been successful in that effort.

I also learned that good people - and bad people - come in all shapes, sizes, colors and nationalities. We must constantly strive not to hate in the plural, although that can be very difficult at times.

I have had no interaction with the Marine Corps since my active duty days, so I'm not sure how badly the Corps has been infected with the [woke and gay mind virus](https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/the-rise-of-wokeness-in-the-military/), but if the American People ever decide to re-embrace the values of Duty, Honor and Country, I am confident that the United States Marine Corps will lead by example.

And so to all Marines past, present and future: _Semper Fi_ and God Speed!

[^1]: But I didn't read the fine print - the Corps guaranteed me a school, but there was no guarantee that I would be assigned to those duties. You go where you are told to go, you do what you are told to do, and you only have two choices: 1) "Aye Aye, Sir", or 2) go directly to jail.

[^2]: MOS = Military Occupational Speciality
