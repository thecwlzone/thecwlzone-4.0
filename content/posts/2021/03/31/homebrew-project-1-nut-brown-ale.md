**Brew Date:** March 12, 2021

**Original Gravity:** 1.059

**Final Gravity:** 1.015

**Notes:**

This was my first use of an electric kettle, the [DigiBoil 9 Gallon](https://www.morebeer.com/products/digiboil-electric-kettle-35l925g-110v.html) unit. This gets me out of the kitchen and away from our expensive JennAir range. It worked pretty well, and I should eventually be able to brew a full 5 gallons if I can solve the wort chilling step satisfactorily. (More on that later.)

Fermentation started about 2 hours after pitching, (the wort may have initially been a bit too warm), and completed about three days later. The fermentation temperature was lower than the recommended 68F to 70F range; the garage stays too cold during March, so lesson learned. But the brew looked, smelled and tasted like beer as it went into the bottle, so that was encouraging. Two weeks of bottle conditioning, and then time for the taste test. Stay tuned...
