## Justification

### I am in good health

Good DNA, vigorous regular exercise, vitamin and mineral supplements and a (mostly) non-junk food diet have kept me in pretty good condition. I believe I can continue to rely on my healthy innate immune system for now.

### The recovery rate from the COVID virus is > 95% for just about everybody

The fatality rate is derived from CDC data on this page, but it's pretty obscure reading. [Dr. John Ioannides](https://metrics.stanford.edu/people/john-ioannidis) of Stanford University confirms the number (7). In any event, fatalities in Colorado are NOT across the board by age (1):

Really old folks are getting hammered, and it's no joke in my age group (70 - 79). But still, the odds are good that you can become ill and recover, thereby acquiring a natural immunity. Also note that the overall fatality rate in Colorado is trending toward zero.

### The fatality rate is comparable to a bad flu season

The 24/7 non-stop media hysteria notwithstanding, the COVID fatality rate is lower than one might expect. Here's the Colorado COVID data from March 19th, 2021 (1) :

![image](@/assets/images/posts/COVID-CO-03-19-2021.jpg)

With a state population of 5.7 million that's a fatality rate of 0.11 per cent, or 108 deaths per 100,000 people.

By way of comparison, here's the Colorado fatality statistics for influenza and pneumonia in 2009 (2):

COVID has been a bad flu season in Colorado.

### There are effective treatments for COVID already available

Where to start here - HCQ, Ivermectin, Vitamin D / Vitamin C / zinc, Hydrogen Peroxide Nebulization. ([DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) searches for these topics are left as an exercise for the reader.) They all have one thing in common: they are inexpensive, readily available, and they do very little to boost your doctor's financial holdings. Results of some of these treatments are summarized at [PrimaryDoctor](https://www.primarydoctor.org/covid-19-is-a-lack-of-nutrients) and (8).

> Healthcare is primarily a business. Any commonly used agent/therapy must generate substantial and even unconscionable revenue for the pharmaceutical companies, the hospitals, and the physicians, or it will never be used or even properly investigated. More likely, it will be suppressed.
>
> Dr. Thomas E. Levy MD (4)

A note about the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) here: ostensibly a government organization, many CDC employees and members hold vaccine patents (6). The [CDC Foundation](https://www.cdcfoundation.org/), a 501 (c) (3) entity, receives grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, all of the major vaccine companies and all of the major pharmaceutical companies, among many others (3, 5). So what is more likely: the CDC will promote the low-cost virus remedies described above or promote vaccines and prescription drugs?

We should remember that the main stream media is also heavily funded by Big Pharma. If you played a modified "Bob Game" (9), and took a drink every time a drug commercial was shown, you would be under the table in less than an hour.

### They are not vaccines, they are fast-tracked gene therapy for the human autoimmune system

[Dr. Joseph Mercola](https://www.mercola.com/) is a controversial figure, but [this article](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2021/03/joseph-mercola/covid-19-vaccines-are-gene-therapy/) is a very comprehensive look at the differences between a vaccine and a genetic therapy.

There is no clear evidence that the injections prevent infection or if people can spread the virus to others after getting the injection.

> "When we start the deployment of this vaccine we will not have sufficient concrete data to prove that this vaccine reduces transmission."
>
> Moderna Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks (11)
> "The COVID-19 vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer–BioNTech, for example, are extremely effective at preventing symptomatic disease, but it is still unclear whether they protect people from becoming infected, or from spreading the virus to others."
>
> Nature News Feature 18 March 2021 (10)
> "The World Health Organization (WHO) warned there is no guarantee that [COVID-19](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/) vaccines will prevent people from being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and transmitting it to other people."
>
> GlobalResearch (12)

This may change as we acquire more data, but I have no desire to be part of the ongoing experiment at this time.

Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) for the Pfizer injection is 0.7%, the ARR for the Moderna injection is 1.1%

The 95% risk reduction bandied about by the media and public health officials is an example of misleading math. What really matters is Absolute Risk Reduction. [This article](https://www.globalresearch.ca/hidden-truth-covid-19-vaccines-interview-dr-ronald-b-brown-phd/5739826) by [Dr. Ronald B Brown](https://publons.com/researcher/1712062/ronald-b-brown-phd/) is heavy reading, but attempts to explain why ARR is the only valid metric. The injections may not be all that effective.

### The Pharma companies are immune (pun intended) from liability

Vaccine manufacturers have been shielded from liability since 1986, thanks to the [National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act), but additional protection has been added for the COVID injections:

> "Under the PREP Act, companies like Pfizer and Moderna have total immunity from liability if something unintentionally goes wrong with their vaccines."
>
> CNBC (13)

Countries without a powerful Big Pharma lobby are being coerced into [fronting money for injury lawsuits](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2021/03/joseph-mercola/pfizer-bullies-nations-to-put-up-collateral-for-lawsuits/).

## Conclusion

No medical procedure is 100% safe or 100% effective. We - _as individuals_ - must do a risk/benefit analysis of every medical procedure that is offered, and make a decision that is best for us. No one else can - or should - make that decision for us.

## Disclaimer

I try to study and review from many sources, but I have mainly drawn information from articles published at [AIER](http://AIER.org), [LewRockwell](http://lewrockwell.com) and [GlobalResearch](https://www.globalresearch.ca/).

I am highly suspicious of pronouncements from politicians, public health officials, mainstream media sources and anybody who has a conflict of interest with the American Medical-Pharmaceutical-Vaccine-Industrial Complex.

Finally, let us always keep one concept firmly in mind:
