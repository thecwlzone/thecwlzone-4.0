The big byline in the [Colorado Springs Gazette](https://gazette.com/) today:

[Without more vaccinations, researchers say Colorado could see hospitalizations spike akin to December](https://gazette.com/premium/without-more-vaccinations-researchers-say-colorado-could-see-hospitalization-spike-akin-to-december/article_d5b4042c-f63e-11eb-b5b6-432e5a89e1de.html)

Actually reading the article points out that this is yet another computer modeling exercise. Give me the code and the data, and I'll give you a different outcome.

Now let's look at today's data from the Colorado COVID web site:

I dunno, looks pretty quiet to me. Here's a chart of cases by age:

![covid case image](@/assets/images/posts/COVID-CO-cases-8-6-2021.jpg)

We're seeing a spike in cases, just like last July. Interesting, but no cause for alarm IMHO. So why the continued fear campaign?

Also of note: 100 X 7240 deaths / 5.7 million CO population = a fatality rate of 0.13 per cent.

I have no idea what "cases" mean anymore. Is Colorado still using the bogus PCR test that even the [CDC is now saying is flawed](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2021/07-21-2021-lab-alert-Changes_CDC_RT-PCR_SARS-CoV-2_Testing_1.html)? And we never get any indication of cycle threshold (Ct) values being used by the various testing facilities.

I am no longer afraid of this virus - actually I never was. I am however, terrified of the Governor, the President, the CDC and the WHO, all of whom seem to be intent on forcing me into an untenable situation regarding mandatory injections.
