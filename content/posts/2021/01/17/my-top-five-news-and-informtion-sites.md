I'm trying to reduce my clickbait addiction. I'm spending too much time checking news ("Oh, God, what are they going to do to us _now_?!"), so I'm trying to be more selective about where I go for online information. Listed below are the top 5 sites I use for news and security-related information:

1. Lew Rockwell - [https://www.lewrockwell.com/](https://www.lewrockwell.com/)

The premier Libertarian web site - "anti-state, anti-war, pro-market". The Political Theater and Blog sections are updated throughout the day. Highly recommended.

2. American Institute for Economic Research - [https://www.aier.org/](https://www.aier.org/)

I discovered these folks just recently - a wealth of in-depth articles by some prolific writers, and they are not just dry economic-jargon articles either. Highly recommended.

3. ZeroHedge - [https://www.zerohedge.com/](https://www.zerohedge.com/)

Updated almost continuously, this is my "news feed". Sensationalist at times, and often venturing into tin-foil hat territory, you don't want to use these guys as your sole source of information. Still, I think it's a good source for the "pulse" of the web.

4. Krebs On Security - [https://krebsonsecurity.com/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/)

The go-to source for in-depth security news and investigation. Brian Krebs is the premier internet security journalist, with lots of credentials, and more importantly, lots of contacts within the security industry.

5. BleepingComputer - [https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/)

A good compendium of computer security and hacker news, updated almost hourly. A good place to check for up-to-date Windows bugs and hacks.
