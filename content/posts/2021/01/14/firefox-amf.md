I have always respected the work done by the [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org) organization, but last week they decided to go "woke", or whatever the expression _du jour_ is. CEO Mitchell Baker has apparently decided that some insurrectionists are more equal than others. Here's the link to his January 8th blog, entitled We Need More Than Deplatforming.

> But as reprehensible as the actions of Donald Trump are, the rampant use of the internet to foment violence and hate, and reinforce white supremacy is about more than any one personality.

So Donald Trump = violence, hate and white supremacy, at least that is the implication.

Now let's explore Mozilla's [blog entries](https://blog.mozilla.org/) for the year 2020... I can find no equivalent condemnation of the looting, arson, destruction and general mayhem instigated by Black Lives Matter and Antifa. (I refuse to add links to those organizations.)

The Firefox browser has been an integral part of my online life almost since its inception in 2004. But I guess we're done now.
