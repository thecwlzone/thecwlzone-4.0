On April 28th, the Lew Rockwell site published an article entitled "[Why I Won't Be Getting the Vaccine](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2021/04/no_author/why-i-wont-be-getting-the-vaccine)", authored by Christian Elliot. The article also had a link to the [Mercola](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/04/27/reasons-not-to-get-covid-vaccine.aspx) site. (You need to register to read it, however.)

Searching for Christian Elliot, I find his article also at The [Children's Health Defense](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/reasons-not-getting-covid-vaccine/) site.

A reference at the bottom of the article points to a web site called [TRUE Whole Human](https://www.truewholehuman.com/home). Here we find the author's business and credentials: "Certified Personal Trainer and Life Coach", and some kind of nutrition certification.

Searching this site, we finally find the [article's "ground zero" URL](https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine), with an origination date of April 5th, 2021, updated on April 19th - "18 Reasons I Won't Be Getting a Covid Vaccine". The article contains 80 citations.

It's a long article, but well worth the reading time. Can you make objections to some of the assertions in the article? You bet, this whole pandemic thing is a complicated subject. But for me the issues boil down to this:

- The COVID virus has a fatality rate roughly comparable to a bad flu season
- The offered injections are "fast-tracked" and experimental in nature

After weighing the risks of the illness versus the "conventional" cure (i.e. the injections), I have determined that the risk of contracting the illness is more acceptable to me. You may need to make a different decision.
