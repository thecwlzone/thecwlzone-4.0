Two weeks of bottle conditioning, so its time for the taste test!

Using my trusty official [Colorado Avalanche](https://www.nhl.com/avalanche/) beer mug:

**Head Retention**: Fair. About what I would expect from a beer made with lighter malts.

**Clarity**: Good, but subject to chill haze. Beer temperature for the above image was 48 F, a bit low for a cask ale "simulation" (should be 55 F to 60 F). A bottle opened at 53 F showed much better clarity. Hey, it's summer, I'll be serving at a colder temp, so chill haze will have to be a "feature".

**Color**: Good, on the light side of the [Pale Ale](https://winning-homebrew.com/English-Pale-Ale.html) spectrum, perhaps, but acceptable.

**Carbonation**: Medium. Probably higher than cask, but the slight increase in the bubbles will make a very good summertime brew.

**Flavor**: Good! The hops come through all the way, but not at all overpowering as in an [IPA](https://homebrewacademy.com/english-ipa-recipe/). The wife pronounced it to be "pretty good", which is a compliment from a non beer drinker.

**Overall**: I'm calling this an ESB, but it's probably more like an [Ordinary Bitter](https://byo.com/article/ordinary-bitter-style-profile/). The [ABV](https://www.brewersfriend.com/abv-calculator/) came in at 3.7%, so it would be a good "session" beer, not that I indulge in drinking binges anymore.

Summer is not a good time for home brewing; it's tough to keep the right temperatures for fermentation unless you have a dedicated cold storage unit, so we'll start the next project probably in September. Cheers!
