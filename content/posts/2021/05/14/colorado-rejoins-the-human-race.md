Gov. Jared Polis [announced today](https://gazette.com/news/polis-ends-mask-order-in-nearly-all-settings-says-masking-is-a-suggestion-not-a/article_14e91d82-b4e3-11eb-87b3-f327b8679e15.html) that masks are now "suggested" but no longer mandatory in Colorado, regardless of whether you have decided to be part of the mRNA clinical trial or if you have opted to be part of the control group. About damn time. Regarding vaccination status, i.e. vaccine passports, the Gov had this to say:

> "We do not believe there's any comprehensive way to do that across society," he said of hinging a mask requirement on a person's vaccination status. "There's no comprehensive way to have a state vaccination passport. It violates people's privacy, there's no practical way to implement it."Â

To be honest, I'm surprised and pleased by the Governor's opinion on the notion of vaccine passports. This aspect of State intervention will be my hill to die on, and I'm most happy to note that the State of Colorado will not - for now anyway - be putting me to the test.

I have had harsh words for the Governor in the past - I appreciate the measured response coming from his office today.
