Our esteemed Governor of Colorado raises his scepter once again and [extends the mask mandates](https://gazette.com/news/polis-extends-mask-mandate-for-30-more-days-but-relaxes-order-for-counties-in-green/article_909a1fe8-9405-11eb-abfe-9f791751a10d.html) until May 2nd. But this time "green" counties are exempted. Green has nothing to do with climate change or CO2 emissions, it's part of a complex set of rules called Colorado COVID Dial 3.0:

Only a government drone could come up with such a Byzantine set of rules. Good luck figuring it all out, and if you do let me know.

So, which counties have what colors? Here we go:

Nice. Travel within Colorado is going to be amusing - which County am I in? What are the rules? Did the County commissioners override any State regulations? Screw it, I'll just do what I want and see if anybody calls me out.

Karen: "Sir, you should be wearing a mask!"

Me: "Hey, we're green now, right? Didn't I just read that somewhere? We'll be fine, have a nice day." Hee hee.
