We've all seen the grocery store clerks frantically wiping down the card readers and the work surfaces before the next customer advances to the check out stand after invoking the Six Foot Magic Circle of Safety ritual. Turns out that isn't necessary, says the CDC, as surface infection of the dreaded COVID-19 virus is "generally considered to be low". (1) As in "generally less than 1 in 10,000". (1)

But now that the Forever War on Terror has been dropped in favor of the Forever War on Viruses I don't expect the deep cleaning obsession to go away anytime soon. "An abundance of caution", dontcha know?
