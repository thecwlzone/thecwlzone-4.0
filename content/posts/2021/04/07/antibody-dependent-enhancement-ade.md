> Data from the study of SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could exacerbate COVID-19 through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Previous respiratory syncytial virus and dengue virus vaccine studies revealed human clinical safety risks related to ADE, resulting in failed vaccine trials.

This is one of the "unknowns" regarding the mRNA inoculations. A [study published in Nature (September, 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5) (1) outlines the current state of the knowledge, although this area is changing so rapidly that there may be more recent available data that I have not seen yet. (I do not trust pronouncements coming from the vaccine manufacturers or from anybody financially compromised by same.)

It'a highly technical paper, and I do not claim a full understanding here, but the tone of the article suggests that we really don't know how widespread ADE is or will be at this point.

> One potential hurdle for antibody-based vaccines and therapeutics is the risk of exacerbating COVID-19 severity via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE can increase the severity of multiple viral infections, including other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and measles.

A [Mercola article](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2020/11/joseph-mercola/how-covid-19-vaccine-can-destroy-your-immune-system/) (2) attempts to explain it more readily for non-virologist types like myself:

> In a nutshell, it means that rather than enhance your immunity against the infection, the vaccine actually enhances the virus’ ability to enter and infect your cells, resulting in more severe disease than had you not been vaccinated.

A few more excerpts form the Lee _et. al._ paper:

> No definitive role for ADE in human coronavirus diseases has been established.
>
> _Lee et. al._ - ADE in human coronavirus infections
>
> Evidence for vaccine-induced ADE in animal models of SARS-CoV is conflicting, and raises potential safety concerns.
>
> _Lee et. al._ - Risk of ADE for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
>
> ADE has been observed in SARS, MERS and other human respiratory virus infections including RSV and measles, which suggests a real risk of ADE for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antibody-based interventions. However, clinical data has not yet fully established a role for ADE in human COVID-19 pathology.

> _Lee et. al._ - Conclusion

Again, each of us - _as individuals_ - must do a risk/benefit analysis for any medical procedure. With a COVID survival rate of > 95% for us old fogies, and > 99% for people under 60 (2), does the administration of an injection that might make the target disease more potent make any sense? Your humble author has decided against the injection for this and other reasons.
