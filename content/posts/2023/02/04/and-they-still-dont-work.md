How many more mask studies need to be done before the mandates finally end up in the dust bin of history? I'm sure tired of beating this dead horse, but OK, one last time...

[Dr. Robert Malone](https://rwmalonemd.substack.com/about 'Dr. Robert Malone') brings this new study to our attention is his article "The 2023 Cochran Review on Physical Interventions Against Respiratory Viruses" ([link here](https://rwmalonemd.substack.com/p/the-2023-cochran-review-on-physical?publication_id=583200&post_id=100291481&isFreemail=true)).

[Steve Kirsch](https://stevekirsch.substack.com/about 'Steve Kirsch') has also weighed in on this one in his [latest newsletter](https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/the-debate-is-over-masks-do-not-work 'latest newsletter').

And here is the link to the [actual study](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub6/full).

I've been watching this issue for quite awhile:

[Masks Still Don't Work](https://www.thecwlzone.com/blog/masks-still-dont-work/ "Masks Still Don't Work") - January 2022

[Wear A Mask Outdoors? No Need](https://www.thecwlzone.com/blog/wear-a-mask-outdoors-no-need/ 'Wear A Mask Outdoors? No Need') - April 2021

[Mask Mandate Madness Continues In Colorado](https://www.thecwlzone.com/blog/mask-mandate-madness-continues-in-colorado/ 'Mask Mandate Madness Continues In Colorado') - April 2021

[Fear Masks Revisited](https://www.thecwlzone.com/blog/fear-masks-revisited/ 'Fear Masks Revisited') - May 2020

The point here is not to say "I told you so" (but I did), but rather to point out that mask efficacy against aerosol-based viral loads has never been a thing. Meanwhile billions of useless masks have ended up in landfills and ocean bottoms.

Enough! If you want to wear a mask, be my guest, but don't you dare try to pressure me into wearing one, and mandates are now grounds for resistance, violent or non-violent, at my discretion.
