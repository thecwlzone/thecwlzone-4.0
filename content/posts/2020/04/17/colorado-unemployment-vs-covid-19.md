Colorado unemployment figures have been raised - what a surprise. Now stands at [230,000](https://gazette.com/business/colorado-unemployment-rates-jumps-in-march-worst-likely-to-come/article_f647e926-80b3-11ea-92b7-bf6180050bd8.html).

From the Colorado COVID-19 site:

- Confirmed cases (statewide): 8675 as of 4/16/2020

- Confirmed deaths (statewide): 374 as of 4/16/2020

[Colorado population](https://www.census.gov/search-results.html?searchType=web&cssp=SERP&q=colorado%20population): 5.7 million

- 100 X 374 deaths / 5,700,000 = 0.006 % fatality rate
- 374 deaths / 5,700,000 X 100,000 = 6.6 deaths per 100,000 population
- 230,000 unemployed / 374 deaths = 615 people out of work for each COVID-19 fatality

- 100 x 8675 cases / 5,700,000 = 0.015 % infection rate
- 8675 cases / 5,700,000 X 100,000 = 152 cases per 100,000 population
- 230,000 unemployed / 8675 cases = 26 people out of work for each COVID-19 case

The "cure" is worse than the disease.
