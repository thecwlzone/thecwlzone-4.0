As I suspected, the (Anti)Social Distancing directives from our wannabe masters has no basis in actual science that I have been able to determine. I was dubious from the very beginning - 6 feet is safe, is it? So what's the lethality percentage at 5 feet? And how much safer is 7 feet? Any data for this stuff? Hello? Hello?

Here is the CDC's (Anti)Social Distancing [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html) - note the complete lack of any scientific or technical or peer-reviewed references.

My conclusion: (Anti)Social Distancing is akin to taking off your shoes at the airport - it has no real safety value, but it's very effective as Pandemic Theater while also turning people into fearful, obedient serfs.

So let's just go back to what Mom told us when we were in grade school: don't cough or sneeze on other people, and stay away from people who are coughing and sneezing. Duh.
