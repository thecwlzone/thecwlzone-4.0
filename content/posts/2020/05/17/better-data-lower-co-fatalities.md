On [May 12th, I noted](https://www.thecwlzone.com/blog/the-scare-tactics-continue/) the big red banner on the online version of the [Colorado Springs Gazette](https://gazette.com/) about how the COVID-19 fatalities in Colorado went over 1000. Since then the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) has started [to differentiate](https://gazette.com/news/coronavirus-in-colorado-878-deaths-attributed-to-covid-19/article_401cf37c-97b4-11ea-bf1d-f74bfba4bd10.html) between people whose deaths were directly attributed to COVID-19 and people who died with the disease, but not because of it, in the death totals, although I note that the _real_ COVID-19 deaths are still downplayed in parentheses on the site page. Still, it's good to see that CDPHE is attempting to be more accurate and transparent with their numbers.

So the COVID-19 fatality actuals now stand at 878 statewide.

100 X 878 fatalities / 7.5 million CO residents = 0.0117 % fatality rate by population

or

878 / 7.5 million X 100,000 = 11.7 deaths per 100,000 population.

El Paso County has not taken the same steps yet, so the total for all COVID-19 related deaths stands at 83.

100 x 83 deaths / 720,000 county population = 0.012 % fatality rate by population

or

83 / 720,000 x 100,000 = 11.5 deaths per 100,000 population.
