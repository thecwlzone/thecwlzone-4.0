I cannot find any credible science regarding the effectiveness of N95 or non-N95 masks for avoiding viral contamination.

OK, _maybe_ a mask will possibly keep you from contaminating other people. Better yet, if you're not feeling well, how about stay home instead?

And _no_ mask is effective if you are a man with a beard. I have sported a beard since 1972, and I don't believe I need to change my appearance because of a nasty cold virus.

Masks are _very_ effective at creating social discomfort. Humans have always relied on facial expressions of other humans to detect fear, anger, danger, contentment, etc. A masked population negates all of that. People are already pretty nervous what with politicians willfully destroying people's livelihoods, and masks are adding to the distress without apparently providing much benefit.
