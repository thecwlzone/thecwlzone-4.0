The latest headlines (May 12, 2020) from the Colorado Springs Gazette [online](https://gazette.com/):

COVID-19 death toll surpasses 1000 - OK, 1009 to be exact.

I have a better headline:

After Two Months of Diminished Civil Liberties Colorado COVID-19 Death Toll is 0.018 %

100 X 1009 deaths / 5.7 million total CO population = 0.01770

1009 deaths / 5.7 million total CO population x 100,000 = 17.7 deaths per 100,000 people
