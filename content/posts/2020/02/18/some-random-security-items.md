- [This is a good article](https://medium.com/@re_53711/seven-simple-steps-toward-online-privacy-20dcbb9fa82) (updated in June 2019) about some things you can do to (somewhat) protect your online privacy.
- You might want to check out the [Good Gopher](https://www.goodgopher.com/) search engine when you are looking for subjects that may be controversial. I still prefer [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) for technical searches.
- You might want to consider using a VPN service - here's a [PCMag comparison](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-vpn-services) of some of the more well known offerings. I'm using [Brave's](https://brave.com/) built in TOR tool at the moment.
- For a truly frightening experience, go over to [mylife.com](https://www.mylife.com/) and see what they know about you. I'll be following up with an article on my attempt to suppress my personal data over there - if I can.
