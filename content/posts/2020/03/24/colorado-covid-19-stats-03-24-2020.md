The latest numbers from Colorado's virus web site:

![covid stats](@/assets/images/posts/co-covid-19-stats.jpg)

- 7 deaths out of 720 cases = 0.97%, well below the scary numbers thrown around by the media.

- 72 people hospitalized - has this really "overwhelmed" the Colorado health care system? If it has, then we have a serious (mis)management problem that needs to be addressed.

I have no faith in our broken political system, but FWIW, here's where you can contact members of Congress:

We need to get America back to work. Isolate the at-risk folks, and get everybody else back on the job. We have accepted much higher casualties from seasonal flu viruses in the past, we need to tell the politicians, "Yes, we see you are doing something, you're wonderful people, now get the hell out of the way".
