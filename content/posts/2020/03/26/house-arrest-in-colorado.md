OK, so the title is clickbait. A "stay at home" order was issued by Colorado's governor yesterday. The official announcement is [here](https://www.colorado.gov/governor/news/gov-polis-announces-statewide-stay-home-order-provides-update-colorado-response-covid-19). But, it doesn't really change anything, so it smells like "Hey, see, we're doing something!" political posturing. It's good to see that cannabis and liquor stores are classified as "essential services". What a joke.

Anyway, we won't comply, and if we're stopped (I really do hope local law enforcement has better things to do) I'll just say, "Hey man, we're on a beer run!"
