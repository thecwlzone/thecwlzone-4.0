COVID-19 [Colorado statistics](https://covid19.colorado.gov/data) as of March 19th, 4 PM:

277 cases
38 hospitalized
22 counties
2,952 people tested
2 deaths

I'm an engineer, so I like numbers. Let's run some:

- Colorado population: ~5.7 million - [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/CO/PST045218)
- Percentage (by population) of COVID-19 cases in Colorado: 0.004859%
- Percentage (by population) of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Colorado: 0.000667%
- Percentage (by population) of COVID-19 deaths in Colorado: 3.509e-7%

The COVID-19 virus is real. So is this year's flu virus. So who benefits from this (IMHO) overreaction to COVID-19? I haven't been able to come to a conclusion yet. I _do_ know who will get _hurt_ from this: everybody but the 1%...
