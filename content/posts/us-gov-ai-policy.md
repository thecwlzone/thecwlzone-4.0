On December 11, 2025, Trump Caesar issued executive order number 14365: [ENSURING A NATIONAL POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/).

May I remind the studio audience that this is the same US Government that brought us the [War on Poverty](https://www.cato.org/commentary/war-poverty-50-despite-trillions-spent-poverty-won), the [War on Drugs](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/6/17/as-the-drug-war-turns-50-the-us-is-still-public-enemy-number-one), the war in [Vietnam](https://www.britannica.com/event/Vietnam-War), the [55 MPH National Speed Limit](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/speed-doesnt-kill-repeal-55-mph-speed-limit) and the [Susan B Anthony Silver Dollar](https://www.mgsrefining.com/blog/history-of-the-susan-b-anthony-dollar-coin-and-why-it-failed-to-gain-popularity/). This track record does not inspire confidence.

I am appalled at how fast AI technology was weaponized - this was quick even by FedGov standards. But I guess we have to stay ahead of the Chinese - ("Mr President, we must not allow ~~a mineshaft gap!~~ [an AI gap!](https://clip.cafe/dr-strangelove-or-how-i-learned-stop-worrying-love-the-bomb-1964/we-must-not-allow-a-mineshaft-gap/)")

### Fearless Prognostication Number 1

An AI Czar will be appointed to run the new Department of Artificial Intelligence to unf--k the new policies that were never going to work anyway. And thus, a new, expensive eternal bureaucracy is formed...

### Fearless Prognostication Number 2

- AI will be used by the multinationals to persuade us to buy stuff we don't need and eliminate all human customer service. If you can't convince the AI Customer Service Agent that your problem is for real, you will be SOL.

- AI will be used by governments to manipulate the masses into complying with the policies desired by the ruling class.

- AI will provide little to no benefit for We The People.
