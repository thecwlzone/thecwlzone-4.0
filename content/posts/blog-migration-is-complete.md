## Summary

The Blog contains a total of 124 posts, stretching back to 2009. Much of the content is technical in nature, and a lot of that is obsolete. My main motivation, however, was to document my observations and research during the COVID hysteria from roughly March, 2020 to present. My innate distrust of Government, Medicine and Media protected me from the worst of the fearmongering, and being retired shielded me from the worst of the authoritarian predations that were occurring. I know that many other people were not so aware and/or not so fortunate.

Whilst migrating the files, I noticed some interesting patterns and trends that I document below, in no particular order of importance:

## Version Timeline

- Version 0, i.e. from 2004 to 2009, of my web site was built with HTML edits using [XEmacs](https://www.xemacs.org/) and pushed to the site using [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/). I have absolutely no recollection of the content or the look and feel of the site for that period of time.

- Version 1.0 was built with a Ruby gem called [webgen](https://webgen.gettalong.org/), around November, 2009.

- Version 2.0 used [nanoc](https://nanoc.app/), and was launched in October of 2013. I also started using [git](https://git-scm.com/) around this time as well.

- Version 3.0 was built with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), and was launched in January of 2018. I created a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account in July of 2021.

- Version 4.0, the current version, is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), and was launched in March, 2025.

## Odds and Ends

- Back in the 2009/2010 time frame I had to do a significant amount of IT work to keep a web site functional - constant hacks on nginx, Passenger, oddball security stuff, etc etc. Thankfully, most web ecosystems have automated much of that now, the big trick nowadays is to build a valid virtual image to deploy to the cloud. Even that is getting easier.

- I finally got an almost [usable internet](/posts/2017/12/19/wireless/) connection in 2018...

- I need to do more [HomeBrew](/tags/homebrew) posts...
